# M1_Assembler

Introduction
-
* The aim of this project is to learn how an assmber is designed and to have an hands on experience on the internal working of an assembler.
* An assembler is a sofware which converts the human readable mneumonics to machine level code viz Hexadecimal.

Objective
-
* The objective is to design a stand-alone assembler for 8051 microcontroller.

Features
-
- Converts the mnemonics present in the test_code.asm to equvalent hexadecimal codes in the ouput file hexout.hex .
- Prints the mnemonics as well as their equivalent hexadecimal codes on the terminal. 

Things to be done
-
- Offset calculation for jump and call instructions.
- Error identification and prompting.
- I/O Port Bit-Control logic

Future Works
-
- Develop the M1_Assembler project into a fully functional IDE with 'Interpret as you type' feature.
- Incorporate simulation feauture.

Research
-
* I have referred to the 8051 instruction set pdf which is available on the internet.
* Several research was conducted in order to induce reusability of code and hence reduce the size of the code which will be presented in the video.

Requirements to run M1_Assembler
-
* Any Windows/Linux machine with the latest version of gcc installed.
