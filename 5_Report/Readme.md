# M1_Assembler_Report

How this assembler works is exclusively described in the working video provided in the repository.

As I'm the only one collaborator, there are features still to be incorporated before being used as a standalone assembler.

Features
-
- Converts the mnemonics present in the code.asm to equvalent hexadecimal codes in hexout.
- Prints the mnemonics as well as their equivalent hexadecimal codes on the terminal. 

Things to be done
-
- Offset calculation for jump and call instructions.
- Error identification and prompting.
- I/O Port Bit-Control logic
